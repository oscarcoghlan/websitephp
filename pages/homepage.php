		<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<br/>
		I'm Oscar, a dedicated software engineering student focused on delivering innovative solutions. On this portfolio website, I share my skills, projects, and experiences.

		<br>
		<br>
		From an early age, I've been intrigued by the possibilities of software engineering. I find fulfillment in creating elegant and efficient solutions to complex challenges, combining creativity and problem-solving. As a student, I actively pursue opportunities for growth and contribution in this ever-evolving field.

		<br>
		<br>
		I am currently completing a degree in software engineering, and have developed a strong foundation in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software design principles. I have extended many classes with Java, wrestled with the c++ standard library, and returned back to the basics with c. I've dipped my toes into .NET, and I've learnt how to express myself on the internet with PHP. I'm consistently curious about exploring new and old technologies.

		<br>
		<br>
		Beyond academia, I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing effective communication and a positive impact. Approachable and enthusiastic, I appreciate diverse perspectives and eagerly contribute my own ideas. I am actively seeking meaningful opportunities to apply my skills, expand my expertise as a software engineer.

			<p>Cellular automata <span class="collapsingtext">(video shows the "maze" ruleset)</span> are a beautiful example of the ways that simple rulesets can create complex results. This project helped me wrap my head around c concepts such as pointers and arrays, and was a neat foray into OpenGL programming. <u><a href="/pages/automata-gl.php">Read more.</a></u></p>

			<p style="float:right; text-align:left">Simulations are, frankly, very cool, one of these cool simulations is the simulation of collisions between particles. For now it's just circles, a fully fleged physics engine is, for now, out of my reach. This project taught me about various c++ std library functions such as vectors and objects. <u><a href="/pages/collisions-cpp.php">Read more.</a></u></p>

			<p>Hugely popular for casual play, the early computer game 'snake' can be considered a veritable behemoth of a social phenomenon. Java is another behemoth of our culture, and it's easy to see why. Programming in Java was a suprisingly pleasant experience. <u><a href="/pages/Java-snake.php">Read more.</a></u></p>
